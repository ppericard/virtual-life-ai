# VirtualLife Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the core architectural components of the VirtualLife simulation. These documents explain the design decisions, implementation details, and usage examples for each part of the system.

## Core Architecture Components

### [Entity-Component-System (ECS)](ecs.md)

The ECS architecture is the foundation of the VirtualLife simulation. It provides a flexible way to define and process entities with different capabilities by composing components. This document explains:

- Core concepts (Entity, Component, System, World)
- Key design decisions
- Component interactions
- Usage examples
- Performance considerations
- Extension points

### [Environment](environment.md)

The environment is where entities exist and interact. It has been refactored into specialized components for better modularity and performance. This document covers:

- Spatial grid implementation
- Boundary condition handling
- Resource management
- Component interactions
- Usage examples
- Performance optimizations
- Future extensions

### [Type System](type_system.md)

The type system enhances code readability, maintainability, and reliability through domain-specific types and protocols. This document explains:

- Core types and their purpose
- Protocol definitions
- Design decisions
- Usage examples
- Relation to the event system
- Type safety best practices

## Additional Documentation

For more information about the VirtualLife project, see the following documents:

- [README.md](../../README.md): Project overview and getting started
- [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md): Development roadmap and implementation phases
- [SETUP.md](../../SETUP.md): Setup instructions and development standards

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation follows this structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief explanation of the component's purpose and role
2. **Core Concepts**: Key abstractions and their relationships
3. **Design Decisions**: Important architectural choices with rationale
4. **Component Interactions**: How components work together
5. **Usage Examples**: Code samples showing how to use the component
6. **Performance Considerations**: Optimizations and efficiency patterns
7. **Extending the Architecture**: Guidelines for adding new features

## Contributing to Documentation

When extending the architecture documentation:

1. Follow the established structure
2. Include code examples to illustrate concepts
3. Explain the rationale behind design decisions
4. Document both the "what" and the "why"
5. Update the index page when adding new documents

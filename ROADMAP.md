# VirtualLife: Artificial Life Simulator - Revised Roadmap

## Project Overview

VirtualLife is an artificial life simulator designed to model the emergence of complex behaviors from simple rules. Unlike detailed biological simulations, VirtualLife focuses on computational generations/turns within a virtual environment, starting with simple cells and parameterized rules to observe emergent patterns and behaviors.

## AI Development Focus

This project is designed to be implemented by an AI agent, which requires special considerations:

- **Exhaustive testing** to verify correctness and handle edge cases
- **Comprehensive documentation** of all components, functions, and classes
- **Explicit type annotations** to enable static type checking and improve code understanding
- **Fail-fast design** with clear error messages for invalid inputs or states
- **Systematic approach** to implementation with clear acceptance criteria

## Simplified Technical Vision

### Core Principles

- **Incremental Development**: Start simple, add complexity progressively
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize by simulation concepts rather than technical layers 
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Use a flat component system with minimal inheritance
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Python's type system for documentation and validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every component must have thorough test coverage
- **Detailed Documentation**: All code must be documented with purpose, usage, and examples

### Technology Stack

- **Primary Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Core Libraries**: NumPy for vectorized operations
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic for models and validation
- **CLI**: Typer for command-line interface
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (Phase 2+)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib (Phase 1), Web-based (Phase 2+)
- **Testing**: Pytest with extensive coverage targets
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings with examples
- **Package Management**: Poetry for dependency management

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing

Focus on core algorithms and critical logic:
- Environment boundaries and entity interactions
- Energy systems and component interactions
- Resource distribution and consumption
- **Each function must have tests for normal operation and edge cases**

## Conclusion

This revised roadmap streamlines the VirtualLife project by focusing on incremental development, starting with a simpler architecture and adding complexity progressively. The phased approach allows for flexibility in implementation while maintaining a clear direction. 

For AI-driven development, the comprehensive testing requirements and detailed documentation standards are essential to ensure a high-quality, maintainable codebase. Each component must be thoroughly tested, and each function must be well-documented with clear examples to facilitate understanding and future development.

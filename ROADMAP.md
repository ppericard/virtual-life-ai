# VirtualLife: Artificial Life Simulator - Revised Roadmap

## Project Overview

VirtualLife is an artificial life simulator designed to model the emergence of complex behaviors from simple rules. Unlike detailed biological simulations, VirtualLife focuses on computational generations/turns within a virtual environment, starting with simple cells and parameterized rules to observe emergent patterns and behaviors.

## AI Development Focus

This project is designed to be implemented by an AI agent, which requires special considerations:

- **Exhaustive testing** to verify correctness and handle edge cases
- **Comprehensive documentation** of all components, functions, and classes
- **Explicit type annotations** to enable static type checking and improve code understanding
- **Fail-fast design** with clear error messages for invalid inputs or states
- **Systematic approach** to implementation with clear acceptance criteria

## Revised Technical Vision

### Core Principles

- **Incremental Development**: Start simple, add complexity progressively
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize by simulation concepts rather than technical layers 
- **System-Based Processing**: Process entities by component type for better performance
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Python's type system and protocols for documentation and validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every component must have thorough test coverage
- **Detailed Documentation**: All code must be documented with purpose, usage, and examples

### Technology Stack

- **Primary Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Core Libraries**: NumPy for vectorized operations
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic for models and validation
- **CLI**: Typer for command-line interface
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (Phase 3+)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib (Phase 1), Web-based (Phase 3+)
- **Testing**: Pytest with property-based testing support

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Focus on testing individual components:
- ECS core functionality
- Environment components
- Individual component behaviors
- System operations
- **Each function must have tests for normal operation and edge cases**

- **Input validation must be thoroughly tested**

### Integration Testing

Test interactions between components:
- ECS world with multiple systems
- Environment with entity interactions
- Configuration loading and application
- Full simulation iterations
- **Component interactions must be verified**
- **System state consistency must be verified**
- **Event propagation must be tested**

### Property-Based Testing

Use for areas where it adds significant value:
- Boundary condition validation
- Entity behavior under different parameters
- Genetic inheritance rules
- **Randomized behavior must be verified for statistical correctness**
- **Invariants must be identified and tested**

### Performance Testing

Ensure efficient operation:
- Spatial partitioning performance
- System-based processing efficiency
- Resource management scaling
- **Benchmarks must be created for critical operations**
- **Performance characteristics must be documented**

## Documentation Strategy

- **API Documentation**: All public interfaces must be thoroughly documented
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design and component interactions must be explained
- **Algorithm Documentation**: Complex algorithms must have detailed explanations
- **User Documentation**: Features must have user-friendly guides
- **Example-Driven Documentation**: All documentation should include concrete examples

## Conclusion

This revised roadmap provides a clear path to refactoring the VirtualLife project with a modern ECS architecture, improved performance, and enhanced type safety. The phased approach allows for incremental development while maintaining a focus on testing and documentation. By following this roadmap, the VirtualLife project will become more maintainable, extensible, and better positioned for future feature additions.

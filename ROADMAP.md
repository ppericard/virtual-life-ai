# VirtualLife: Artificial Life Simulator

## Project Overview

VirtualLife is an artificial life simulator designed to model the emergence of complex behaviors from simple rules. Unlike detailed biological simulations, VirtualLife focuses on computational generations/turns within a virtual environment, starting with simple cells and parameterized rules to observe emergent patterns and behaviors.

The project aims to create a flexible framework capable of simulating scenarios ranging from Conway's Game of Life to complex ecological systems featuring predator-prey relationships, mutualism, and other emergent behaviors.
